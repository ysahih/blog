# Wordle and Calculator
This repository contains two projects: a clone of the popular game Wordle and a simple calculator built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

# Calculator
The calculator is a basic arithmetic calculator built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division operations on two numbers.

To use the calculator, open the calculator folder and open the index.html file in your web browser.

# Wordle Clone
The Wordle clone is a web-based version of the game Wordle, where players have to guess a five-letter word within six attempts. The game provides feedback on each guess, indicating which letters are correct and in the right position, which letters are correct but in the wrong position, and which letters are not in the word at all.

To play the Wordle clone, simply open the word-day-folder folder and open the index.html file in your web browser.


Both projects are designed to be simple and easy to use, and can serve as examples for those learning web development.
Feel free to explore the code and make any modifications or improvements as you see fit. If you have any questions or feedback, please don't hesitate to reach out. Thank you for checking out this repository!
